# Three reasons why the improvement is better:
1. The first reason that this is better is because it better models the real world scenario... The
Paperboy code is now 'asking' the customer for a payment. The paperboy does not have direct
access to the wallet. 
2. The second reason that this is better is because the Wallet class can now change, and the paperboy
is completely isolated from that change. If the interface to Wallet were to change, the Customer
would have to be updated, but that's it... As long as the interface to Customer stays the same, none
of the client's of Customer will care that he got a new Wallet. Code will be more maintainable,
because changes will not 'ripple' through a large project.
3. The third, and probably most 'object-oriented' answer is that we are now free to change the
implementation of 'getPayment()'. In the first example, we assumed that the Customer would have
a wallet. This led to the null pointer exception we talked about. In the real world though, when the
paper boy comes to the door, our Customer may actually get the two bucks from a jar of change,
search between the cushions of his couch, or borrow it from his roommate. All of this is 'Business
Logic', and is of no concern to the paper boy... All this could be implemented inside of the
getPayment() method, and could change in the future, without any modification to the paper boy
code.
